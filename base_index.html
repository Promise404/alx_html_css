 <h1>Think</h1>
    <p>Pause, take a breath, and think of the solution.
    Make sure you understand all of the required concepts and
    algorithms before you proceed to solve tasks.
    </p>

<h2>Think more + Whiteboard</h2>
    <p>Write or draw out your problem on a whiteboard or paper.
        It’s easier to visualize your problem when it isn’t pure code
    .</p>

<h3>Ask why?</h3>
        <p>Whether or not your code runs when you input it,
            make sure you know why it doesn’t (or does) work
            without looking at the error message.
